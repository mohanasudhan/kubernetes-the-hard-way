# deploy new version in the side and send % of traffic to new
# you can have minimum number of pod in the new version, so the traffic is small
# wait for it to be successful, 
# then proceed the update (rolling or blue/green)

# service mesh helps in controlling the traffic
# it uses selector logic to send traffic to both version for time being.
